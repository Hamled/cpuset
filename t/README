CPUSET Tests
============

* trigger-all.sh
  - a shell script designed to trigger most code paths in cpuset
  - as a side effect it can be used to check if something broke after a code
    change
  - procedure (as root):
    1) run trigger-all.sh with known-good version of cset utility, store output
       into a file
    2) re-run the same test with your changed version - use both Python 2 and 3
       - storing script output into files
    3) compare these three files side by side (e.g. in vimdiff) looking for
       irregularities
   Hints: Use PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 to get correct output of test_util.py when
   redirected into pipe. Consider filtering out numbers from script output as
   they change (primarily PIDs) and typically form just noise. See
   run-trigger-all.sh for an example.

* test_cset.py (run from trigger-all.sh)
  - the test assumes 4 CPUs
  - run test as root
  - set up a shield before running the test:
        cset shield -s -c 2-3 -k on
